# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

# Purpose 

With my new knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, I was tasked with using the features in the provided dataset to help Beks create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

The data used was From Alphabet Soupâ€™s business team, which is  a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. 


To complete this we used TensorFlow with hidden layers and a binary classification output layer and optimize this model by varying parameter in order to determine accuracy. 

# Results 

The deep learning neural network model did not reach the target accuracy and left us with an accuracy of 71%. This model would not be recommended for use due to this average result.
